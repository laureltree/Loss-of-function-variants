# Loss-of-function-variants

Repo containing code to perform a loss-of-function variant analysis (detection through to validation) using small- to large-scale genomic data.

Loss-of-function (LOF) variants are genetic variants predicted to seriously disrupt the function of protein-coding genes and are traditionally viewed in the context of severe Mendelian disease.

An example of loss-of-function mutations are frameshift mutations, stop-gained mutations etc.

In more detail, this repo contains:

1) Overview of what data and software access is needed to perform the analysis
2) Example code to filter variant data and run VEP
3) Steps on how to proceed once candidate variants have been identified
